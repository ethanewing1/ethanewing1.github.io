Analysis of condos and their prices in New York City over time. 

The where_when notebook explores where, when, and what types of condominiums were built. First we took a look at when the condos were built. We analyzed graphs that displayed the trends of when the condos were built and used historical contexts to try explain the trends we saw. Then, we used the GeoPy library to fetch the longitude and latitude for the address provided for each condo. We used these coordinates and the folium library to make a map that displayed where different condos were being built. We also wanted to see if there was a dependency between the classification of the condominiums and the borough that they resided in. We used a Chi-Square Test to test the hypothesis that the condos' classification was independent of its borough.
